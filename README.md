## ðŸš¨ Here for  [Unit Test Generator](README-UnitGen.md) (ut-gen)? 
Keploy's new launched world's first unit test generator(ut-gen) implementation of [Meta LLM research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09171), it understands code semantics and generates meaningful unit tests, aiming to:

- **Automate unit test generation (UTG)**: Quickly generate comprehensive unit tests and reduce the redundant manual effort.

- **Improve edge cases**: Extend and improve the scope of tests to cover more complex scenarios that are often missed manually.

- **Boost test coverage**: As codebase grows, ensuring exhaustive coverage should become feasible.


This is my first open source repository by taking reference from Keploy Open Source Repository
